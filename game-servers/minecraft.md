### Getting Started

To connect to our Minecraft server you will first have to update your Minecraft to the version that our server is currently using, this can be done through the Minecraft launcher. Then you will need to download the [Forge version](https://adfoc.us/serve/sitelinks/?id=271228\&url=https://maven.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.19.2-43.2.0/forge-1.19.2-43.2.0-installer.jar) we are using too, specifically, the one stated in our _(Current Version Info)_ or it will not work. Finally, you will then have to download the correct version of the [Modpack](https://www.mediafire.com/file/44qy3j3cs5jrcq8/Vanguard-SMP-v01a.zip/file) we are using, once again stated above.

You can always do all of this automatically by using the [CurseForge App](https://download.curseforge.com/) which will update your Minecraft, Forge, and our Modpack automatically. Once you have installed the CurseForge App you can download our Modpack which can be found on CurseForge [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/vanguard-smp).

When you have found our Modpack on CurseForge look towards the right and you will see an Install button _(as shown in the image below)_ which will connect to your CurseForge App installing it automatically.

Or simply through the CurseForge App, by searching for "Vanguard", and when you find our Modpack press the install button and it will do everything for you. Once it is complete press play and then refer to the information below for connecting to our server.

### Server Information

When you first open the game, click on (Multiplayer) and then (Add Server). Under where it says (Server Name) you can put what you want here, I will use (Vanguard Server) for example, then on the second line (Server Address) you can put our domain (vgnserver.xyz) as shown below.

### Information

This pack is still a work in progress and as such is unfinished. We're constantly working on and looking for mods that would work well with the style that we're trying to achieve while trying to balance out what's already there. While we're also more than happy to take suggestions from our community.
