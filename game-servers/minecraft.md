To connect to our Minecraft server you will first have to update your Minecraft to the version that our server is currently using, this can be done through the Minecraft launcher. Then you will need to download the [Forge version](https://adfoc.us/serve/sitelinks/?id=271228\&url=https://maven.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.19.2-43.2.0/forge-1.19.2-43.2.0-installer.jar) we are using too, specifically, the one stated in our _(Current Version Info)_ or it will not work. Finally, you will then have to download the correct version of the Modpack we are using, once again stated above.

You can always do all of this automatically by using the [CurseForge App](https://download.curseforge.com/) which will update your Minecraft, Forge, and our Modpack automatically. Once install the CurseForge App you can download our Modpack which can be found on CurseForge here.
